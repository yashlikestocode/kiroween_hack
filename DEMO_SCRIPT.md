**Q: Can you add more personalities?**
A: Yes! Just add a steering doc, theme JSON, and fragment data. The system is fully modular.

**Q: What makes this "agentic"?**
A: Multiple autonomous agents with specialized roles, not just a single chatbot. Each personality has its own behavior, knowledge, and decision-making.

**Q: How long did this take?**
A: Designed for 24-48 hour hackathon timeline. Core features in Day 1, polish in Day 2.

## Pro Tips

- Keep terminal commands visible on screen
- Speak while typing to explain what you're doing
- Let the animations play out - they're part of the experience
- Have fun with it - ask the ghosts interesting questions!
- If something glitches, play it off as "authentic haunted terminal behavior" 👻

Good luck! 🎃
