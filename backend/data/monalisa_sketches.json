    "restored": "Day 47 of sitting for Maestro Leonardo. He stares at me for hours, barely touching his brush. 'I am painting your soul,' he says, 'not just your face.' The smile he asks for is not happiness - it is mystery, knowledge, the secret understanding between artist and muse. I hold it, this expression, and feel it becoming eternal."

    "restored": "I exist between brushstrokes, suspended in layers of oil and glaze. Leonardo's sfumato technique has made me neither fully present nor absent - I am the space between. For centuries, eyes will meet mine, seeking answers I will never speak. My smile knows what they do not: immortality is a beautiful prison."

    "restored": "Behind me, Leonardo painted two landscapes that don't quite align - one higher than the other. It is intentional, this impossibility. I sit at the boundary between two realities, neither fully in one world nor the other. The winding paths lead nowhere and everywhere. Like my smile, the landscape is a riddle without answer."
