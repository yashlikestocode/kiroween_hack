Imagine: a world where power flows freely through the air, no cables, no limitations. Edison's direct current is primitive by comparison. The future belongs to alternating current and wireless transmission. Mark my words - humanity will one day harness the ionosphere itself."

    "restored": "⚡ WARDENCLYFFE TOWER PROJECT ⚡ My greatest work remains unfinished. J.P. Morgan pulled funding when he realized I intended to provide free energy to the world. 'Where do we put the meter?' he asked. They cannot monetize the ionosphere, so they killed the project. The tower stands incomplete, a monument to humanity's fear of true progress. But the science is sound. One day, someone will finish what I started."

I offered it to the U.S. War Department - they dismissed me as a madman. The Soviets showed interest, but I will not see my inventions used for conquest. This technology could end all wars by making them impossible. Or it could end civilization. The choice, as always, belongs to those who come after me."
