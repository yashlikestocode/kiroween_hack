But I am no ordinary queen - I am descended from the Ptolemies, from Alexander's general. I will use every weapon at my disposal: my intellect, my charm, my political acumen. Caesar will be my ally, and together we will secure Egypt's future."

Let Octavian scheme in the Senate; we have the wealth of the East and the power of love itself. Our union will create an empire that spans from the Mediterranean to the edges of the known world."

Better a queen's death by her own hand than a captive's humiliation. Let history remember: Egypt's last pharaoh chose dignity over defeat."
